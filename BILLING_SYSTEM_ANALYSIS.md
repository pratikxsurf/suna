# Billing System Security & Robustness Analysis Report

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Analyzed by:** AI Code Auditor  
**Status:** ⚠️ NEEDS ATTENTION - Several Critical Issues Found

---

## Executive Summary

The billing system demonstrates **good architectural foundation** with several robust patterns including circuit breakers, reconciliation services, and idempotency checks. However, there are **CRITICAL ISSUES** that could lead to:

- 💸 **Revenue loss** (double credit grants)
- 🔐 **Security vulnerabilities** (trial abuse, insufficient validation)
- 🐛 **Data inconsistency** (race conditions, balance mismatches)
- 💥 **System failures** (webhook processing errors, transaction failures)

**Overall Assessment:** 🔶 **60/100** - Functional but needs hardening before production scale

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES

### 1. **SEVERE: Double Credit Grants on Renewals**
**Location:** `webhook_service.py:667`, `subscription_service.py:479-754`  
**Severity:** 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Direct Revenue Loss

**Problem:**
Multiple competing code paths can grant credits for the same billing cycle:
1. `invoice.payment_succeeded` webhook grants credits
2. `customer.subscription.updated` webhook ALSO grants credits
3. Both can race and process simultaneously

**Evidence in Code:**
```python
# subscription_service.py:667-673
if last_renewal_period_start and last_renewal_period_start == subscription.get('current_period_start'):
    logger.warning(f"[DOUBLE CREDIT BLOCK] Invoice webhook already processed period")
    return  # THIS CHECK IS FRAGILE
```

**Why It's Broken:**
- The check relies on `last_renewal_period_start` being set BEFORE the second webhook arrives
- If both webhooks process concurrently, both can see NULL and pass the check
- No database-level transaction locks prevent race conditions
- Cache invalidation happens AFTER credits are granted (line 860-862)

**Real-World Scenario:**
```
T0: Invoice webhook starts processing renewal
T1: Subscription webhook starts processing (sees last_grant_date=NULL)
T2: Invoice webhook grants $100, updates DB
T3: Subscription webhook grants $100 AGAIN (passed all checks)
Result: User gets $200 instead of $100
```

**Impact:** At scale (1000s of renewals/day), this could cost **thousands in lost revenue monthly**.

---

### 2. **CRITICAL: Trial Security - Bypass Possible**
**Location:** `trial_service.py:148-246`  
**Severity:** 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Direct Revenue Loss

**Problems:**

#### 2.1 Ledger Check is Too Permissive
```python
# Lines 221-231
if 'trial credits' in desc or 'free trial' in desc:
    has_actual_trial = True
elif 'start a trial' in desc or 'please start a trial' in desc:
    continue  # ⚠️ BYPASSES CHECK
```
An attacker could add ledger entries with "please start a trial" to bypass detection.

#### 2.2 Race Condition Window
```python
# Lines 158-170
trial_history_result = await client.from_('trial_history').select('id')...
if trial_history_result.data:
    raise HTTPException(status_code=403)  # NO LOCK BETWEEN CHECK AND INSERT
```

**Exploit:**
```
T0: User A checks trial_history (empty)
T1: User B checks trial_history (empty) - same account_id
T2: User A creates trial, passes all checks
T3: User B creates trial, passes all checks
Result: TWO trials for same account
```

#### 2.3 No Rate Limiting
A malicious user could:
- Spin up multiple accounts
- Start trial on each
- Abuse $5 x N accounts = Free credits at scale

**Recommendation:** Add rate limiting by IP, email domain, payment method fingerprint.

---

### 3. **CRITICAL: No Atomic Balance Updates**
**Location:** `credit_manager.py:59-142`  
**Severity:** 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Data Corruption Risk

**Problem:**
Balance updates happen in 3 separate database operations without transaction:
```python
# 1. READ balance
result = await client.from_('credit_accounts').select(...)  

# 2. UPDATE balance (⚠️ NO TRANSACTION)
await client.from_('credit_accounts').update(update_data)...

# 3. INSERT ledger (⚠️ SEPARATE OPERATION)
await client.from_('credit_ledger').insert(ledger_entry)...
```

**Race Condition:**
```
T0: User has $100
T1: Process A reads balance ($100), calculates new ($120)
T2: Process B reads balance ($100), calculates new ($150) 
T3: Process A writes $120
T4: Process B writes $150 (⚠️ OVERWRITES A's update)
Result: Lost $20 in credits
```

**Why It Matters:**
- Happens during concurrent operations (user making purchase while subscription renews)
- Happens during webhook retries
- No row-level locking in Supabase/PostgreSQL prevents this

**Solution:** Use PostgreSQL transactions:
```python
async with client.transaction():
    current = await client.from_('credit_accounts').select(...).with_lock()
    # ... calculations ...
    await client.from_('credit_accounts').update(...)
    await client.from_('credit_ledger').insert(...)
```

---

### 4. **HIGH: Webhook Idempotency Insufficient**
**Location:** `webhook_service.py:48-52`  
**Severity:** 🟠 **HIGH** - Duplicate Processing Risk

**Problem:**
```python
cache_key = f"stripe_event:{event.id}"
if await Cache.get(cache_key):
    return {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Event already processed'}
```

**Issues:**
1. **Cache can fail** - If Redis/cache is down, duplicate processing occurs
2. **Cache TTL (3600s)** - After 1 hour, same event could be reprocessed
3. **No database backup** - Should persist event_id in DB as authoritative source

**Better Pattern:**
```python
# Check DB first (authoritative)
existing = await client.from_('processed_webhook_events').select('id').eq('stripe_event_id', event.id)
if existing.data:
    return {'status': 'duplicate'}

# Then process and record
await client.from_('processed_webhook_events').insert({'stripe_event_id': event.id})
```

---

### 5. **HIGH: Circuit Breaker State Not Persisted**
**Location:** `stripe_circuit_breaker.py:16-82`  
**Severity:** 🟠 **HIGH** - Service Availability Risk

**Problem:**
Circuit breaker state is in-memory:
```python
self.failure_count = 0
self.last_failure_time: Optional[datetime] = None
self.state = CircuitState.CLOSED
```

**Impact:**
- If process restarts during OPEN state, circuit immediately closes
- Multiple processes (horizontal scaling) each have independent circuit breaker
- One process could be in OPEN state while others are CLOSED

**Result:** 
- Stripe API continues to get hammered by some processes
- No coordinated backoff across fleet
- Potential API ban from Stripe

**Solution:** Use Redis/shared state for circuit breaker.

---

### 6. **HIGH: Reconciliation Can Create Infinite Loops**
**Location:** `reconciliation_service.py:53-60`  
**Severity:** 🟠 **HIGH** - Credit Duplication Risk

**Problem:**
```python
ledger_check = await client.from_('credit_ledger').select('id').eq(
    'metadata->>stripe_payment_intent_id', purchase['stripe_payment_intent_id']
).execute()

if not ledger_check.data:
    result = await credit_manager.add_credits(...)  # ⚠️ CAN DUPLICATE
```

**Race Condition:**
```
T0: Reconciliation job checks ledger (empty)
T1: Webhook processes payment, adds credits
T2: Reconciliation job adds credits AGAIN
Result: Double credits granted
```

**Why It Happens:**
- Reconciliation runs on schedule (line 27: last 24h)
- Webhook can process same payment simultaneously
- No distributed lock prevents both from running

---

### 7. **MEDIUM: No Refund Handling**
**Location:** Entire system  
**Severity:** 🟡 **MEDIUM** - Manual Intervention Required

**Missing:**
- No webhook handler for `charge.refunded` or `payment_intent.refunded`
- No automatic credit deduction on refund
- No refund tracking in database

**Impact:**
- User gets refund but keeps credits
- Manual admin intervention required for every refund
- No audit trail

---

### 8. **MEDIUM: Commitment Cancellation Logic Flawed**
**Location:** `subscription_service.py:379-420`  
**Severity:** 🟡 **MEDIUM** - User Experience & Legal Risk

**Problem:**
```python
if datetime.now(timezone.utc) < end_date:
    subscription = await stripe.Subscription.modify_async(
        subscription_id,
        cancel_at=int(end_date.timestamp())
    )
```

**Issues:**
1. No validation that `cancel_at` date is actually honored by Stripe
2. If Stripe API fails, local state becomes inconsistent
3. No monitoring for scheduled cancellations
4. User could be billed beyond commitment if cancellation fails silently

---

### 9. **MEDIUM: Expiring Credits Logic Inconsistent**
**Location:** `credit_manager.py:237-304`, `webhook_service.py:824`  
**Severity:** 🟡 **MEDIUM** - User Confusion

**Problem:**
`reset_expiring_credits` doesn't actually check expiration dates:
```python
async def reset_expiring_credits(self, account_id, new_credits, ...):
    # ⚠️ Just replaces expiring_credits value, doesn't check expires_at
    await client.from_('credit_accounts').update({
        'expiring_credits': float(new_credits),
    })
```

**Issues:**
- Expired credits may not actually expire
- `cleanup_expired_credits` function exists but not called automatically
- No cron job or scheduled task to run cleanup

**Missing:**
```python
async def enforce_credit_expiration():
    # Should run daily
    expired = await client.from_('credit_ledger').select(...).lt('expires_at', now())
    for entry in expired:
        await deduct_expired_credits(entry.account_id, entry.amount)
```

---

### 10. **LOW: Decimal Precision Issues**
**Location:** Multiple locations  
**Severity:** 🟢 **LOW** - Potential Rounding Errors

**Problem:**
Mixing float and Decimal:
```python
# credit_manager.py:104
'balance': float(new_total)  # ⚠️ Loses precision

# subscription_service.py:831
full_amount = Decimal(new_tier['credits'])  # From float dict
```

**Impact:**
- Rounding errors accumulate over time
- `$0.009999` vs `$0.01` can cause issues
- Balance reconciliation shows false discrepancies

**Solution:** Keep Decimal throughout entire pipeline, only convert to float at API boundary.

---

## 🔧 RACE CONDITIONS CATALOG

### RC-1: Concurrent Subscription Updates
**Scenario:** User upgrades tier while renewal processes
**Location:** `subscription_service.py:479`, `webhook_service.py:667`
**Impact:** Double credit grant or missing credits
**Fix:** Use DB row locks with `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`

### RC-2: Concurrent Credit Purchases
**Scenario:** Multiple purchases complete simultaneously
**Location:** `credit_manager.py:59-142`
**Impact:** Balance corruption
**Fix:** Serialize updates with queue or DB transactions

### RC-3: Webhook Retry vs. New Event
**Scenario:** Stripe retries webhook while new event arrives
**Location:** `webhook_service.py:27-78`
**Impact:** Duplicate processing
**Fix:** DB-backed idempotency with unique constraints

### RC-4: Trial Check Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use (TOCTOU)
**Scenario:** Two trial start requests process simultaneously
**Location:** `trial_service.py:158-170`
**Impact:** Multiple trials per account
**Fix:** Database unique constraint + optimistic locking

### RC-5: Balance Read-Modify-Write
**Scenario:** Multiple credit deductions at same time
**Location:** `credit_manager.py:152-235`
**Impact:** Negative balance despite sufficient funds
**Fix:** PostgreSQL row-level locks

---

## 🛡️ SECURITY VULNERABILITIES

### S-1: Trial Abuse Vectors
1. **Multiple accounts** - No email/payment verification
2. **Ledger manipulation** - Can add entries to bypass checks
3. **No device fingerprinting** - Same user = infinite trials

### S-2: Webhook Signature Verification
**Current:** ✅ Good - Using Stripe's built-in verification
```python
event = stripe.Webhook.construct_event(payload, sig_header, config.STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET)
```

### S-3: No Rate Limiting on Billing Endpoints
**Missing:** Rate limits on:
- `/billing/purchase-credits` 
- `/billing/start-trial`
- `/billing/subscription/create`

**Risk:** Abuse, DoS, brute force attacks

### S-4: Insufficient Input Validation
```python
# payment_service.py:40-41
'unit_amount': int(amount * 100)  # ⚠️ No max/min validation
```

**Attack:** User could request $1000000 credits, cause integer overflow

---

## 🔍 DATA CONSISTENCY ISSUES

### DC-1: Balance Drift Detection
**Good:** Reconciliation service exists (`reconciliation_service.py:101-142`)  
**Bad:** Only runs manually, no automated scheduled execution

### DC-2: Orphaned Records
**Missing:** Cleanup for:
- Expired checkout sessions (never completed)
- Cancelled subscriptions with remaining scheduled tasks
- Zombie trial records (started but never converted/cancelled)

### DC-3: Audit Trail Gaps
**Missing:**
- Who cancelled subscription (user vs. admin vs. system)
- Refund reasons
- Commitment modification history

---

## 📊 MONITORING & OBSERVABILITY GAPS

### Missing Metrics:
1. **Double credit grants** - No alert when same period processed twice
2. **Failed webhook processing** - Logs but no alerting
3. **Circuit breaker trips** - No notification when Stripe API fails
4. **Balance reconciliation results** - No dashboard
5. **Trial conversion rate** - No tracking
6. **Revenue leakage** - No detection

### Recommended Monitoring:
```python
# Add to credit_manager.py
metrics.increment('credits.granted', tags=['source:webhook', 'tier:starter'])
metrics.histogram('credits.balance', value, tags=['account_id:xyz'])
metrics.gauge('circuit_breaker.state', 1 if OPEN else 0)
```

---

## ✅ WHAT'S GOOD

### 1. **Circuit Breaker Pattern** ✅
Well-implemented with exponential backoff and half-open state.

### 2. **Idempotency Checks** ✅  
Present in multiple places (webhook processing, credit adds).

### 3. **Reconciliation Service** ✅
Proactive detection and fixing of failed payments.

### 4. **Detailed Logging** ✅
Extensive logging helps debugging (though needs structured logging).

### 5. **Commitment Tracking** ✅
Proper handling of yearly commitments with cancellation restrictions.

### 6. **Trial Security** ✅ (mostly)
Multiple checks prevent basic trial abuse.

async def test_concurrent_credit_grants():
    # Launch 10 simultaneous credit grants
    # Verify final balance matches expected
    
async def test_webhook_retry_idempotency():
    # Send same webhook 5 times
    # Verify credits granted exactly once
    
async def test_trial_abuse():
    # Attempt to start trial twice
    # Verify second attempt fails
```

---
